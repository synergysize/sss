# v32: Hovertip Update Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed "Wallet Details" header from tooltips**
   - Removed the header text from both the HTML/DOM tooltip and the 3D canvas tooltip
   - This provides a cleaner, more streamlined tooltip appearance

2. **Removed "Holds Fartcoin only"/"Holds both tokens" line**
   - Eliminated the token holdings type description line
   - This information was redundant since the specific token amounts are displayed below

3. **Added clickable wallet address that links to Solscan**
   - Modified the HTML tooltip to make the address a hyperlink
   - Applied proper styling with underline to indicate it's clickable
   - The link format follows: `https://solscan.io/account/[WALLET_ADDRESS]`
   - Added explicit `target="_blank"` attribute to open in a new tab/window
   - Implemented `pointer-events: auto` CSS to ensure clicks work properly

4. **3D Tooltip Improvements**
   - Added an underline to the address text in the 3D canvas tooltip to indicate it's clickable
   - Implemented a click handler that checks if clicks occur within the address area
   - Added logic to open the Solscan URL in a new tab when the address is clicked

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Modified both `directTooltipFix.js` for the HTML tooltip and `walletTooltip.js` for the 3D tooltip
- Added click event handler to the canvas element for the 3D tooltip interaction
- Implemented proper hit detection for the clickable area in the 3D tooltip
- Maintained tooltip positioning and other existing functionality
- Improved user experience by making wallet addresses directly actionable
