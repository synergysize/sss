# Debug Visuals Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Debug Visual Elements
- Removed the grid helper (2000x2000 red/white grid)
- Removed the axes helper (XYZ colored axes)
- Removed the test spheres (red sphere at origin and green sphere at box center)

### 2. Reduced Debug Console Logging
- Removed excessive initialization logging
- Removed periodic camera position logging
- Removed control type logging during animation
- Removed bounding box calculation logging
- Removed device detection verbose logging
- Kept only essential error logging

### 3. Hidden Debug Console Element
- Set the console element display to 'none'
- Removed debug text injection

## Code Sections Modified

1. **Grid and Axes Helpers**
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   const axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper(300);
   scene.add(axesHelper);
   const gridHelper = new THREE.GridHelper(2000, 20, 0xff0000, 0xffffff);
   scene.add(gridHelper);
   ```

2. **Debug Test Spheres**
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED:
   const testSphere = new THREE.Mesh(
     new THREE.SphereGeometry(200, 32, 32),
     new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, wireframe: true })
   );
   testSphere.position.set(0, 0, 0);
   scene.add(testSphere);
   
   const centerSphere = new THREE.Mesh(
     new THREE.SphereGeometry(200, 32, 32),
     new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00, wireframe: true })
   );
   centerSphere.position.copy(boxCenter);
   scene.add(centerSphere);
   ```

3. **Verbose Console Logging**
   - Removed various `console.log` statements throughout the code
   - Kept only essential error logging for critical failures

## Verification

All debug visuals have been removed while maintaining core functionality:
- Wallet points still display correctly with proper colors
- Starfield background is still intact
- Controls continue to function as expected (FlyControls on desktop, OrbitControls on mobile)
- No red/green test spheres
- No grid or axes helpers
- No console spam
