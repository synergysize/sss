# Jetpack Left Shift Update (v4)

## Changes Implemented

1. **Activation Key Change**
   - Changed jetpack activation from Spacebar to Left Shift key
   - Added dedicated event listeners to track Left Shift key state
   - Modified all code references from spacebar to Left Shift

2. **Control Logic Updates**
   - Decoupled jetpack activation from FlyControls' internal up/down movement
   - Maintained existing Up/Down movement with R/F keys
   - Preserved all physics and movement behaviors

3. **User Interface Updates**
   - Updated all control instructions to reflect the new activation method
   - Changed text from "HOLD SPACEBAR" to "HOLD LEFT SHIFT" in UI elements
   - Maintained existing fuel meter display

4. **Debug Enhancements**
   - Added specific logging for Left Shift key state changes
   - Maintained existing fuel level and jetpack state logging
   - Version number incremented to v4

## Preserved Functionality

All existing jetpack mechanics were maintained:
- Forward speed boost when activated
- Gradual slowdown (inertia) after release
- Fuel drain during use and recharge when idle
- Prevention of activation when fuel is empty
- Visible fuel meter in corner

## Technical Implementation

- Added window-level event listeners for 'keydown' and 'keyup' events specifically for 'ShiftLeft' code
- Created a separate boolean flag (shiftKeyPressed) to track Left Shift state
- Modified all references from spacebarPressed to jetpackKeyPressed throughout the code
- Removed conditional logic that was previously needed to handle spacebar vs. other up controls
