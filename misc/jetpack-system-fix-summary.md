# Jetpack System Fix Summary (v3)

## Issues Resolved

1. **Jetpack Activation Mechanics**
   - Jetpack now only activates when the spacebar is held down
   - Immediately deactivates when spacebar is released
   - Added comprehensive activation/deactivation logging for debugging

2. **Movement Improvements**
   - Increased forward movement speed significantly in the direction the camera is facing
   - Applied a customizable boost factor (currently 2.5x normal speed)
   - Ensured proper directional thrust aligned with camera view

3. **Physics Enhancements**
   - Added light inertia through reduced damping (0.2 instead of 0.5)
   - Player now gradually slows down when jetpack is turned off
   - Implemented half-gravity (0.5) for low-friction floating feel
   - Maintained proper momentum while maintaining controllability

4. **Fuel System Implementation**
   - Made fuel meter prominently visible in the top-right corner
   - Redesigned with better styling and visual feedback
   - Fuel drains at a consistent rate while spacebar is held
   - Fuel recharges automatically when jetpack is not in use
   - Prevents activation when fuel is completely depleted
   - Requires minimum threshold to reactivate after depletion

5. **Visual Debugging**
   - Added detailed console logging for jetpack activation status
   - Implemented fuel level tracking and display
   - Added physics state logging (velocity, damping, gravity)
   - Updated UI controls guide with clear instructions

## Technical Implementation Details

- Modified damping factor from 0.5 to 0.2 for smoother inertia
- Added gravity factor of 0.5 for subtle downward pull
- Increased jetpack drain rate from 1.0 to 1.2 for more challenging fuel management
- Increased refill rate from 0.5 to 0.8 for better gameplay flow
- Enhanced fuel meter UI with improved visibility and positioning
- Fixed time-based calculations to be frame-rate independent
- Added version number increment (now v3) in the top right

## Usage Instructions

1. Use WASD keys for basic movement control
2. Drag mouse to look around
3. HOLD the spacebar to activate the jetpack boost
4. Monitor fuel levels in the top-right corner
5. Allow jetpack to recharge when not in use

## Next Steps

- Consider further tweaking of physics parameters based on user feedback
- Potentially add sound effects for jetpack activation/deactivation
- Evaluate possibility of adding visual thruster effects
