# Jetpack Control Mechanics Fix Report

## Overview

Fixed the jetpack control mechanics in the 3D Blockchain Visualizer to ensure proper separation between regular WASD movement and jetpack boost functionality.

## Changes Made

1. **Jetpack Activation**:
   - Only spacebar now activates the jetpack
   - Removed the previous dual-control system where W key also provided a boost

2. **Thrust Direction**:
   - Jetpack now applies thrust in the forward direction of the camera
   - Eliminated the previous upward-only movement

3. **Movement Priority**:
   - Jetpack thrust overrides normal WASD movement when active
   - When jetpack is inactive, WASD controls function normally

4. **Fuel System**:
   - Fuel drains only when spacebar is held
   - Fuel regenerates gradually when spacebar is released
   - Meter accurately reflects current fuel level
   - Color coding indicates fuel status (green → yellow → red)

5. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused variables like `jetpackAcceleration` and `jetpackMaxBoost`
   - Simplified the movement calculation logic
   - Improved control flow for better readability

6. **User Interface**:
   - Updated control instructions to clearly indicate spacebar activates jetpack

## Testing

The updated functionality was verified in the browser:
- Spacebar activates forward thrust
- WASD provides normal movement when jetpack is inactive
- Fuel meter depletes during jetpack use and regenerates when idle
- Zero-gravity drift remains intact

## Conclusion

The jetpack mechanics now function as specified, with clear separation between normal movement and jetpack boost. The user experience is more intuitive with the spacebar providing a distinctive boost function without interfering with regular navigation.
