# Blockchain Visualizer Update: Enhanced Scale and Proportions

## Version 26 Update

This update enhances the scale and proportions of the existing 3-tier wallet fractal layout, creating a more immersive and visually impressive representation of the blockchain ecosystem.

### Key Enhancements

1. **Massive Scale Increase**
   - The entire visualization now feels 3× larger
   - Core sphere: 4× larger (now 10,000 units)
   - Parent nodes: ¼ the size of center (500 units)
   - Wallet nodes: ¼ the size of parent nodes (125 units)

2. **Variable Spacing**
   - Parent nodes: Variable distance from core (8,000-15,000 units)
   - Wallet nodes: Variable distance from parents (1,500-3,500 units)
   - Creates a more organic, natural-looking structure

3. **Improved Materials**
   - Added MeshPhysicalMaterial with clearcoat effect
   - Enhanced emissive properties for better glow
   - Maintained color coding: white core, green/blue nodes

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Expanded starfield to match the increased scale
   - Increased movement speed to navigate the larger structure
   - Optimized animation for smoother performance

### Visual Impact

The updated visualization creates a more dramatic sense of scale and depth:

- The dominant white core clearly establishes the central point of the structure
- Medium-sized parent nodes form a dynamic middle layer at varying distances
- Small wallet nodes create detailed clusters around each parent
- Variable spacing creates a more organic, natural distribution

This update preserves the hierarchical relationship between the three tiers of nodes while creating a more immersive and visually stunning experience that better showcases the complexity and scale of blockchain data.

### Navigation

- The camera has been positioned to properly frame the expanded structure
- Flight controls have been adjusted for the larger scale
- Jetpack boost provides faster travel through the visualization

The end result is a visualization that feels truly massive in scale, with clear hierarchy and improved depth perception.
